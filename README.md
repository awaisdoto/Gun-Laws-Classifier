# Gun-Laws-Classifier
# This is a classifier which basically predicts whether there is a gun law in a state or not, depending on various things like murder rates etc.
# It uses various Classification algorithms like decision trees, random forest, naive bayes and K-nearest neighbors to predict the gun law. 
# At the end, these different algorithms are compared with their accuracy, and depending upon whichever algo performed the best that algo's predicted result is shown to the user.
# Also just so you know, this was just a project for a lab in my university.
